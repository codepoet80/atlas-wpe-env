# Building the Atlas WPE engine from scratch

Reproducible instructions for cross-building the Atlas browser engine (the WPE WebKit backend,
`libWPEBackend-atlas.so`, and the `BrowserServer-atlas` host) for the HP TouchPad (webOS 3.0.5),
from a clean Linux host.

> **Status:** every step below is ✅ — run green here, from the committed scripts, and the resulting
> engine was A/B-tested against the shipped binary on a real TouchPad (§6).
>
> Two honest caveats. The toolchain build (§2) and the full ~400 MB device pull (§3 `device`) were not
> re-run from scratch for this pass — the toolchain is pinned by its defconfig, and the device pull's
> novacom `tar`/`get` mechanics were verified against a live device on a small subset. Everything else,
> including a clean-room sysroot rebuild and a full BrowserServer build against it, was.

## Repositories

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| [`atlas-browser-app`](https://github.com/Herrie82/atlas-browser-app) | Enyo UI front-end (builds with the webOS SDK alone) |
| [`atlas-wpe-backend`](https://github.com/Herrie82/atlas-wpe-backend) | `wpe-atlas-backend.c` → `libWPEBackend-atlas.so`; `BrowserPageWPE.{cpp,h}` (merged into BrowserServer); WebKit `patches/` |
| [`BrowserServer`](https://github.com/Herrie82/BrowserServer) | base `Src/` + `Yap/` IPC that `BrowserPageWPE` merges into |
| `atlas-wpe-env` (this repo) | build scripts, the toolchain recipe, deploy/packaging |

Clone them as siblings, e.g. under `~/Projects` or `~/webos/wpe`.

## The target ABI (why a custom toolchain)

The device's *system* glibc is ancient (2.8, Sourcery 2008) and the kernel is 2.6.35, but the engine
ships and runs against its **own bundled runtime** (binaries `patchelf`'d to a bundled loader). Confirmed
off a running device, that runtime is:

- **glibc 2.23** (crosstool-NG), soft-float ABI, loader **`ld-linux.so.3`**
- **armv7-a / cortex-a8 / neon**, `-mfloat-abi=softfp -mthumb`
- gcc **12.x** (C++23 for WebKit 2.52.4; BrowserServer must share the libstdc++ ABI)

A stock modern cross-toolchain won't do: its glibc is far newer, so its binaries need GLIBC symbols the
device's 2.23 lacks. Hence we build a device-matched toolchain.

## 1. Host prerequisites ✅

Debian/Ubuntu host:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc g++ make bison flex gperf \
  help2man texinfo libtool-bin automake autoconf gawk \
  libncurses-dev unzip rsync bzip2 wget patch git
```

## 2. Cross-toolchain via crosstool-NG ✅

The exact toolchain is pinned as a crosstool-NG **defconfig** in this repo:
[`toolchain/atlas-arm-crosstool.defconfig`](toolchain/atlas-arm-crosstool.defconfig)
(glibc 2.23, gcc 12, binutils 2.40, linux-2.6.32 headers, cortex-a8, neon, softfp).

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch crosstool-ng-1.26.0 \
    https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng
cd crosstool-ng
./bootstrap && ./configure --enable-local && make -j"$(nproc)"

# apply the Atlas toolchain recipe
cp /path/to/atlas-wpe-env/toolchain/atlas-arm-crosstool.defconfig defconfig
./ct-ng defconfig

# build it (~1–3 h; installs to ~/x-tools/arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi)
./ct-ng build
```

Result: `~/x-tools/arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi-{gcc,g++,...}`
(gcc 12.3.0, glibc 2.23). ~20 min on a 12-core host.

**Validate it runs on the device** (recommended smoke test). A C++ binary built with the arch flags and
`patchelf`'d to the engine's bundled runtime runs on the TouchPad:

```sh
arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi-g++ -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon \
    -mfloat-abi=softfp -mthumb -O2 -pthread hello.cpp -o hello        # note: glibc 2.23 → -pthread needed
patchelf --set-interpreter /var/atlas252/lib/ld-linux.so.3 --set-rpath /var/atlas252/lib hello
novacom put file:///tmp/hello < hello && novacom run file://bin/chmod -- 755 /tmp/hello
novacom run file:///tmp/hello          # → prints, using the bundled glibc 2.23 + libstdc++
```
(`/var/atlas252` is the postinst-created symlink to the engine's `wpe-252` dir.)

**Known issue — glibc 2.23 manual vs modern texinfo.** glibc 2.23 compiles fine, but `make install`
fails at the *documentation* step on hosts with texinfo ≥ 7 (`cannot stat '.../manual/libc.info*'`) —
the new `makeinfo` won't generate glibc 2.23's old manual. The recipe works around it with
`CT_GLIBC_EXTRA_CONFIG_ARRAY="MAKEINFO=:"` (already set in the defconfig), which tells glibc to treat
`makeinfo` as absent and skip the manual entirely. No effect on the produced libraries.

## 3. Staging sysroot ✅ (scripted)

The sysroot (`$STAGING`, default `~/atlas-staging`) holds the engine's **libraries** (to link against) and
matching **dev headers** (to compile against). It is built by one script:

```sh
atlas-wpe-env/stage-sysroot-atlas.sh all         # = headers + device + linklib
atlas-wpe-env/stage-sysroot-atlas.sh everything  # ... plus webkit-deps (needed only for §8)
```

or one phase at a time:

| Phase | What it does | Needs |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `headers` | `include/` — pinned Debian armhf dev debs (extracted, never installed) + host Khronos/zlib + libwpe + this repo's `reconstructed-headers/` | network |
| `device`  | `lib/` (engine runtime, `deviceroot/wpe-252/lib`) and `rootfs/` (`/usr/lib` + `/lib`, ~84 MB, for `-rpath-link`) | a TouchPad running Atlas, over novacom |
| `linklib` | derives `linklib/` + the unversioned dev symlinks from `lib/` | — |
| `webkit-deps` | `webkitdeps/` — 65 pinned armhf dev packages (headers + `.pc`) for building WebKit itself, §8 | network |

Overridable: `STAGING`, `REPOS`, `DEB_CACHE`, `CRYPTO_DR`, `LIBWPE_TAG`.

**Header provenance.** Every dev deb is pinned by content hash and fetched from **snapshot.debian.org**,
which keeps every version forever (the regular pool 404s as sid moves on). The script verifies sha256
after download and refuses to continue on a mismatch. `dpkg-deb -x` extracts them without installing, so
nothing touches the host.

| deb | version | why |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `libwpewebkit-2.0-dev` | 2.52.5-1 | matches the engine's WebKit C API |
| `libqt4-dev` + `libqtwebkit-dev` | 4.8.7 / 2.3.4 | compile-only interface types (no Qt is linked) |
| `libglib2.0-dev` | 2.74.6-2+deb12u9 | glib headers + the **32-bit ARM** `glibconfig.h` (arch-dependent — must not come from the host) |
| `libsoup-3.0-dev` | 3.6.6-1 | soup3, as the engine uses |
| `libssl-dev` | 3.6.3-1 | OpenSSL 3 (generic + `arm-linux-gnueabihf` `opensslconf.h` overlay) |
| `libpng-dev` / `libpng12-dev` | 1.6.58-1 / 1.2.50 | png16 is what `OffscreenBuffer` links |

EGL/GLES2/KHR and zlib headers are arch-neutral, so the host's are used. `libwpe` headers come from the
1.16.0 release tag. `PmLogLib.h` is generated from `PmLogLib.h.in` into `$REPOS/PmLogLib`.

**Two things the `linklib` step gets right that are easy to get wrong by hand:**

1. **OpenSSL major.** `wpe-252/lib` ships *both* OpenSSL 1.1 and 3. The unversioned dev symlink is created
   from the **highest** real version (`sort -V`), so `-lssl` resolves to `libssl.so.3` — the engine's TLS
   stack. A naive glob picks `libssl.so.1.1` and silently links BrowserServer against the wrong major.
2. **Toolchain libs are excluded** from `linklib/` (`libc`, `libm`, `libpthread`, `libstdc++`, `libdl`,
   `librt`, `libresolv`, `libgcc_s`, the loader). The device copies are glibc 2.23 too, but letting them
   shadow the toolchain's own leaves `__libc_csu_init` undefined at link time.

> Verified: a clean-room `headers` run reproduces the previously hand-assembled `include/` tree
> **byte-for-byte**, and BrowserServer built against the scripted sysroot is identical to the hand-built
> one apart from the build timestamp and one baked `__FILE__` path (see *Build determinism* below).

## 4. Environment ✅

Source the portable env file (a reconstruction of the original, machine-specific `env-glibc-gcc125.sh`):

```sh
source /path/to/atlas-wpe-env/env-atlas-cross.sh
# honors overrides: TOOLCHAIN=... STAGING=...
# the existing build-*.sh scripts also accept it via:  export WPE_ENV=.../env-atlas-cross.sh
```

It sets `TARGET/CC/CXX/AR/…`, the `-march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp -mthumb`
flags, `STAGING`, and points `pkg-config` at the sysroot.

## 5. Build the components

**a) `libWPEBackend-atlas.so`** — ✅ verified (builds, and renders frames in the live engine on-device):

```sh
source atlas-wpe-env/env-atlas-cross.sh
atlas-wpe-env/build-backend-atlas.sh            # → atlas-wpe-backend/libWPEBackend-atlas.so
```

This portable script encodes what works: the arch flags, the staging `-I`/`-l` paths, and a post-link
`patchelf --replace-needed libEGL.so→libEGL.so.1 / libGLESv2.so→libGLESv2.so.2` (the device deploys the
Adreno driver under the versioned names, but its own SONAME is unversioned). The result's `NEEDED` list
matches the device's shipped backend exactly and exports `_wpe_loader_interface`. Validated by swapping
it into `/var/atlas252/lib`, restarting `atlas`, and confirming `[wpe-atlas] frame_rendered` in
`/media/ram/bs-atlas.log`.

**b) BrowserServer** — ✅ builds from source (all 22 objects compile + links to an ARM executable whose
`NEEDED` matches the deployed binary) **and validated on-device**: swapped into `wpe-252/`, it renders
identically to the shipped binary (A/B on `example.com`: frames 113 vs 115, WebProcess spawns 12 vs 13,
0 crashes each). This is where the `BrowserPageWPE.cpp` engine changes (e.g. the viewport fix) live.

```sh
source atlas-wpe-env/env-atlas-cross.sh
REPOS=~/Projects atlas-wpe-env/build-browserserver-atlas.sh   # → browserserver-build/obj/BrowserServer-atlas
```

Extra source repos to clone under `$REPOS` (headers only; nothing built):
[Herrie82/BrowserServer](https://github.com/Herrie82/BrowserServer),
[openwebos/luna-service2](https://github.com/openwebos/luna-service2),
[isis-project/WebKitSupplemental](https://github.com/isis-project/WebKitSupplemental),
[isis-project/pbnjson](https://github.com/isis-project/pbnjson),
[openwebos/PmLogLib](https://github.com/openwebos/PmLogLib).

All the headers and link libs this needs — `wpe-webkit-2.0`, Qt 4.8.7 + QtWebKit, soup3, OpenSSL 3,
png16, `PmLogLib.h`, the reconstructed QtWebKit stubs, and the device-pulled `lib/`/`rootfs/`/`linklib/` —
are staged by `stage-sysroot-atlas.sh` (§3). Nothing is installed on the host.

> **The `--unresolved-symbols=ignore-in-object-files` trap — read this before adding sources.**
> The link uses that flag to tolerate the unfinished QtWebKit hit-test stubs. It does **not** fail the
> build on a missing symbol: it binds the call to **address 0**, producing a binary that SIGSEGVs (`blx 0`)
> the moment that call is reached. This shipped once — `Src/Settings.cpp` calls
> `webOS::WebSettings::initSettings()`, which lives in `WebKitSupplemental/misc/weboswebsettings.cpp`,
> a file the build never compiled. Result: BrowserServer segfaulted inside `InitSettings()` on every
> startup, `/media/ram/bs-atlas.log` stayed 0 bytes, and upstart respawned it forever.
>
> Step 5 of `build-browserserver-atlas.sh` now disassembles the binary and **fails** on any `blx 0`
> outside a small allowlist. The allowlist (`asyncCmdGetImageInfoAtPoint`, `asyncCmdInspectUrlAtPoint`,
> `clearCache`, `BrowserPage::hitTest`) is still **latent breakage**: long-press image info / inspect
> and cache-clear will segfault until the upstream de-QtWebKit'ing is finished.
>
> `WebKitSupplemental/misc/*.cpp` is compiled with two deviations — no `-DQT_NO_KEYWORDS` (upstream uses
> Qt's `foreach`) and `wpe-shims/` first on the include path, which supplies a no-op QtWebKit
> `qwebsettings.h`. Stock QtWebKit lacks Palm's `setPluginSupplementalPath()` and `FullScreenEnabled`,
> and the WPE port must not link libQtWebKit at all; the settings that matter are applied to
> `WebKitSettings` in `BrowserPageWPE`.

**Debugging a startup crash.** `LD_DEBUG=libs` is usually a red herring (the library sets match the
shipped binary exactly). Get a real backtrace instead:

```sh
# on device
echo '/media/internal/core.%e.%p' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
ulimit -c unlimited          # the boot wrapper already sets this
# host, against the UNSTRIPPED binary
arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi-gdb -q browserserver-build/obj/BrowserServer-atlas core.BrowserServer-a.NNN \
  -ex 'set solib-search-path <deviceroot>/wpe-252/lib' -ex 'bt 25'
```

Device gotchas: there is **no `timeout`** on the device (use `cmd & sleep N; kill $!`), and `novacom run`
does not relay stdout — push a script that redirects into a file and `novacom get` it afterwards.

**Two repo bugs found + worked around** (candidates for upstream PRs):
1. `CodeGen/BrowserYapCommandMessages.defs` `KeyDown`/`KeyUp` were stale — declared `uint16_t key,
   uint16_t modifiers` but `BrowserServer.cpp` implements `int key, int modifiers, int chr`. Fixed the
   `.defs` to match (CodeGen only understands `int`, not `int32_t`).
2. `BrowserPageWPE.h::hitTest()` returns a `QWebHitTestResult{}` — a compile-only QtWebKit type with no
   backing lib ("QtWebKit link TBD"). Left unresolved in the test link (never reached by a page load).

## 6. Deploy + test ✅

`build-browserserver-atlas.sh` already links with the bundled loader as the interpreter and the device
rpath baked in, so the binary needs no `patchelf` — just swap it in and restart the engine:

```sh
DR=/media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosports.app.atlas/deviceroot/wpe-252

# 1. back up the shipped binary FIRST (/media/internal survives a restart)
novacom run file://bin/cp -- "$DR/BrowserServer-atlas" /media/internal/BrowserServer-atlas.bak

# 2. stop the engine (the upstart job, then any stragglers)
novacom run file://sbin/stop -- atlas
novacom run file://usr/bin/pkill -- -f WPEWebProcess
novacom run file://usr/bin/pkill -- -f BrowserServer-atlas

# 3. push + install
novacom put file:///media/internal/BrowserServer-atlas < browserserver-build/obj/BrowserServer-atlas
novacom run file://bin/cp -- /media/internal/BrowserServer-atlas "$DR/BrowserServer-atlas"
novacom run file://bin/chmod -- 755 "$DR/BrowserServer-atlas"

# 4. restart
novacom run file://sbin/start -- atlas
```

> novacom over USB gets flaky while the engine is restarting — expect to retry a step or two.

**Validated (2026-07-24):** the from-source (unmodified) BrowserServer renders identically to the shipped
binary. A/B on `example.com`: 113 vs 115 frames, 12 vs 13 `WPEWebProcess` spawns, 0 crashes each. (The
~13 spawns per load is normal Atlas behaviour — the shipped binary does it too.) Logs are in
`/media/ram/bs-atlas.log`. Restore with the `.bak` from step 1.

`deploy-252.sh` / `redeploy-webkit.sh` cover the fuller flows (WebKit runtime, test harness).

### The deadlock watchdog and `-d` (do not raise it back)

The boot wrapper runs the engine with `-d 90000`. That number is load-bearing for the **GPU wedge**
([#3](https://github.com/Herrie82/atlas-wpe-env/issues/3)): a wedge parks BrowserServer's main thread in
`futex_wait_queue_me` with yap still accepting but nothing being serviced, and the yap deadlock watchdog
(`YapServer.cpp`) is the **only** thing that recovers it — it `abort()`s, upstart respawns, and the app's
cards reload themselves.

It used to be `-d 600000`, raised from the 15 s default because a memory-pressure GC stall would trip the
watchdog and abort a perfectly healthy engine. The cost was that a wedge took **14 min 30 s** to clear,
which every user reads as permanent. `YapServer.cpp` now gates the abort on the process **also being
idle**, which distinguishes the two cases the tick counter alone cannot:

| | main loop ticking | process CPU |
|---|---|---|
| GC / swap-in stall | stalled | pegs a core → abort deferred (bounded by `kMaxBusyStalls`) |
| GPU wedge | stalled | ~idle → abort immediately |

Measured on-device 2026-08-03 against a real wedge: `Deadlock detected; aborting! (528 cpu ticks in the
last 90000ms)` — 528 against a 2250-tick (25% of one core) threshold — wedge to serving pages again in
**63 s**.

Two practical notes: that message goes to **syslog** (`/var/log/messages`), *not* `bs-atlas.log`, so grep
the right file when checking whether the watchdog fired. And do not lower `-d` below ~90 s on an engine
built **before** this gate, or GC stalls will start killing healthy engines again.

## 7. Package the installable ipk ✅

`build-ipk-atlas.sh` produces the real, installable `org.webosports.app.atlas_<ver>_all.ipk` (~99 MB
packed, ~209 MB installed). It is a portable reproduction of `full-restore-atlas.sh` + `build-ipk.sh`,
which cannot run outside Herrie's tree (they source the unpublished `env-glibc-gcc125.sh` and expect
`staging-glibc-252`, a `wpewebkit-2.52.4/_b` build dir, and `camera-path-a`).

```sh
source atlas-wpe-env/env-atlas-cross.sh
atlas-wpe-env/build-ipk-standalone.sh         # -> atlas-browser-app/ipks/standalone/org.webosports.app.atlas_<ver>_all.ipk
atlas-wpe-env/build-ipk-feed.sh               # -> atlas-browser-app/ipks/feed/... (Preware feed build)
DOSTRIP=0 atlas-wpe-env/build-ipk-atlas.sh    # keep symbols, for gdb
```

**Where each part of the payload comes from — read this before claiming "built from source":**

| Part | Source |
|------|--------|
| `BrowserServer-atlas`, `libWPEBackend-atlas.so` | **built from source here** (§5) |
| boot wrapper, NPAPI adapter, upstart jobs, ls2 roles, `atlas-sensord`, `qspkd`, postinst/prerm | committed in this repo |
| Enyo front-end (`appinfo`/`index.html`/`source`/`css`/`images`/`db`) | `atlas-browser-app` checkout |
| WPE WebKit (`libWPEWebKit`, `WPEWebProcess`/`WPENetworkProcess`, injected bundle) | **built from source** (§8), when a `build-webkit-atlas.sh` destroot is present |
| GStreamer stack, glibc-2.23 runtime, `share/`, `webkit-data`, `fonts.conf`/`gstomx.conf`, `qcamd`/`qmicd` | **`$DEVICEROOT_REF`** — a deviceroot pulled off a working device |

**As of 2026-07-25 WPE WebKit is also built from source** (§8) and `build-ipk-atlas.sh` ships it,
falling back to `$DEVICEROOT_REF` only when no build is present. The final line of its output states
which engine the package actually contains.

**Get `$DEVICEROOT_REF`** — do this *before* removing the browser from a device, it is also your rollback
artifact:

```sh
DR=/media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications
novacom run file://bin/tar -- czf /media/internal/atlas-app-backup.tgz -C "$DR" org.webosports.app.atlas
novacom get file:///media/internal/atlas-app-backup.tgz > atlas-app-backup.tgz
mkdir -p ~/atlas-device-backup/ref && tar xzf atlas-app-backup.tgz -C ~/atlas-device-backup/ref
novacom run file://bin/rm -- -f /media/internal/atlas-app-backup.tgz
# default DEVICEROOT_REF = ~/atlas-device-backup/ref/org.webosports.app.atlas/deviceroot
```

The script **fails loudly** rather than shipping a subtly broken browser. It checks the engine runtime
files exist, that `libWPEWebKit` carries the Adreno-220 WebGL fix (the `dlopen("libGLESv2.so")` ANGLE
fallback — without it every WebGL page SIGSEGVs the WebProcess), that the WebRTC transport/media and
Ogg/Vorbis/Opus GStreamer plugins are all present, and that `BrowserServer-atlas` really is linked against
the bundled `ld-linux.so.3`.

### Installing it

`postinst` must run as **root**, so install through Preware or WebOS Quick Install — *not* `palm-install`.
Headless over novacom, using the same appinstaller service those front-ends use:

```sh
novacom put file:///media/internal/atlas.ipk < ~/Projects/atlas-browser-app/ipks/standalone/org.webosports.app.atlas_0.9.9_all.ipk
# then, ON THE DEVICE (see the -n warning below):
luna-send -n 20 -f palm://com.palm.appinstaller/installNoVerify \
  '{"target":"/media/internal/atlas.ipk","subscribe":true,"uncompressedSize":214232}' > /tmp/reply.log 2>&1 &
LS=$!; i=0
while [ $i -lt 72 ]; do grep -q 'SUCCESS\|FAILED' /tmp/reply.log && break; sleep 5; i=$((i+1)); done
kill -9 $LS 2>/dev/null
sh /path/to/ipk-postinst.sh        # installNoVerify does NOT run postinst — run it yourself, as root
```

> **`luna-send -n <n>` blocks until it receives exactly `n` replies.** `installNoVerify` emits only a
> handful, so `luna-send -n 20` never returns and the whole novacom session appears hung. Always run it
> in the background with a bounded poll, as above. (`remove` happens to emit exactly 3, which is why
> `-n 3` returns cleanly there.)
>
> **`installNoVerify` installs the payload and registers the package, but does not execute `postinst`** —

> all be missing and the engine will not start. Run `ipk-postinst.sh` manually as root afterwards. It is
> idempotent, so running it again after a Preware/Quick Install is harmless.

`postinst` copies the device's real Adreno driver over the versioned GPU sonames, creates the
`/var/atlas252` bridge symlink, installs the adapter/upstart/ls2-role/db8 files into the rootfs, registers
the db8 kinds, and starts the engine. It warns (does not fail) if `/usr/lib/ssl11/libssl.so.1.1` — the
community OpenSSL 1.1 package — is absent; without it HTTPS won't work.

---

### Build determinism

Two things keep builds from being bit-identical across hosts. Neither affects behaviour, but know about
them before you diff two binaries:

1. **A build timestamp** — `BrowserPageWPE.cpp` puts `__DATE__ " " __TIME__` in the `about:` diagnostics
   table, so every build differs by those 6 bytes.
2. **Absolute paths baked into `__FILE__`** — Qt's assert macros in `qt4/QtCore/qstring.h` embed the
   header's full path, so the length of your `$STAGING` path shifts `.rodata`.

Apart from those two strings, the same sources + the same pinned sysroot produce an identical binary —
that is how the `stage-sysroot-atlas.sh` output was verified against the hand-assembled sysroot.
Add `-ffile-prefix-map=$STAGING=/staging` (and a `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`-derived date) if you ever need
byte-reproducible output.

## 8. Building WPE WebKit itself

Only needed when changing WebKit source or its `patches/` — for backend/BrowserServer work you link
against the WebKit libs pulled in step 3. But this is what makes the build reproducible end-to-end
instead of depending on a prebuilt engine runtime.

```sh
atlas-wpe-env/stage-hosttools-atlas.sh           # ruby + unifdef, unprivileged
atlas-wpe-env/stage-sysroot-atlas.sh webkit-deps # 65 pinned armhf dev packages
source atlas-wpe-env/env-atlas-cross.sh
source atlas-wpe-env/hosttools-env.sh
atlas-wpe-env/apply-webkit-patches.sh            # extract 2.52.4 + the Atlas series, in order
atlas-wpe-env/build-webkit-atlas.sh configure
atlas-wpe-env/build-webkit-atlas.sh build        # ~8500 targets
```

> **`build-webkit-252.sh` is not this.** That script disables VIDEO, GSTREAMER, WEBRTC and WEBGL — the
> shipped engine plainly has all of them. It is an experiment, kept for reference. The feature set in
> `build-webkit-atlas.sh` was reconstructed from the shipped `libWPEWebKit-2.0.so.1`: its 65 `NEEDED`
> libraries and its symbol table (343 DFG references and zero CLoop → **JIT is on**, which is also why
> `wpewebkit-2.52.4-softfp-jit.patch` exists).

**Patch order matters.** `mediastream-camera` is authored on top of `mdpdetile-videosink`, and
`webrtc-mono-opus` on top of `webrtc-receive-av`; applying them alphabetically fails.
`apply-webkit-patches.sh` encodes the working order and is idempotent.

**Dependencies are headers, not builds.** The engine links what the device already ships, so
`webkit-deps` stages only dev headers and `.pc` files — 65 armhf packages pinned by version + sha256 in
[`webkitdeps.list`](webkitdeps.list), fetched through an unprivileged apt root spanning
bookworm/trixie/jammy. Versions track the **device's sonames**, not what is current:

| Package | Pinned to | Because |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `libicu-dev` | **70.1** (jammy) | ICU mangles every symbol with its major (`u_strToUpper_70`); any other ICU will not link against the device's `libicuuc.so.70` |
| `libgstreamer1.0-dev` + plugins | **1.20.1** (jammy) | device ships GStreamer 1.20.7 |
| `libjpeg62-turbo-dev` | Debian | device ships `libjpeg.so.62`; Ubuntu's is `libjpeg.so.8` |
| `libcairo2-dev` | 1.18 (trixie) | device ships cairo 1.18.0 |

About half the list is *transitive pkg-config providers* (libpcre2, brotli, expat, libdw, libunwind,
orc, nghttp2, ffi, the X11 headers cairo's `.pc` references). They matter more than they look:

> **`pkg-config --modversion` succeeding proves nothing.** Only `--cflags --libs` walks the transitive
> `Requires:`. A missing `libpcre2-8.pc` surfaces as `Could NOT find Soup3: Found unsuitable version ".."`,
> because WebKit's Find modules silently fall back to scraping version headers when pkg-config fails.
> Also, `apt-get download` aborts the **entire batch** on one bad package name — fetch one at a time, or
> you will believe you staged things you did not.

**Four cross-build traps**, each worth a failed configure:

1. **`unset CFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS` before cmake.** `env-atlas-cross.sh` aims them at the BrowserServer
   build, and `-L$STAGING/lib` puts the *device's* `libc.so` on the link line, shadowing the toolchain's
   and leaving `__libc_csu_init` undefined — CMake's trivial-program check fails outright.
2. **No `CMAKE_SYSROOT`.** `--sysroot` replaces the toolchain's own sysroot, so libc's headers stop
   resolving. Dependency headers arrive as explicit `-I` from pkg-config instead.
3. **`$STAGING/rootfs` must not be on the link path** — unlike the BrowserServer build. rootfs is the
   device's *system* tree (glibc 2.8). Because `linklib` deliberately excludes libc/libpthread, ld falls
   through to rootfs and picks up the 2.8 `libpthread.so.0`, whose `GLIBC_PRIVATE` symbols
   (`__default_sa_restorer_v2`, `h_errno`, …) do not exist in glibc 2.23.
4. **Add `/usr/include/<triplet>` explicitly.** Debian multiarch keeps `gpg-error.h`, `ffi.h`,
   `jconfig.h`, `openssl/` and `libxslt/` there, and pkg-config never emits that directory.

`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is the **device** path (`/var/atlas252`, the short symlink `postinst` creates),
with `DESTDIR` staging the tree locally. That bakes correct `PKGLIBEXECDIR`/`PKGLIBDIR` at build time,
so the binary prefix-patching `deploy-252.sh` performs is no longer needed.
