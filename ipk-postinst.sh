# GPU: stage the Adreno driver under every name the engine asks for. THREE names are needed, and a fresh
# install that is missing any of them gets a browser that renders nothing:
#   libEGL.so.1 / libGLESv2.so.2  - what libWPEBackend-atlas.so NEEDs (verified with readelf).
#   libEGL.so (unversioned)       - what the vendor libGLESv2 blob itself NEEDs. Its SONAME is the
#                                   unversioned "libEGL.so" too, so today this only resolves by luck:
#                                   either the already-loaded libEGL.so.1 satisfies it under its SONAME,
#                                   or the loader falls through to /usr/lib/libEGL.so. Stage it locally
#                                   so neither piece of luck is required.
# cryptofs (like vfat) has no symlinks, so COPY rather than symlink.
